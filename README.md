## Setting the Baseline
**Client**: Fast Cars  
**Motivation** for consulting service:  
- client is under pressure from investors to address climate change
- new government regulations are expected to force a phase-out of Internal Combustion Engine used in their cars.
- They have set carbon emission reduction targets using SBTi, but it's at the beginning phase.
**Task**: help them deliver on their Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) pledge to reduce their carbon emissions  
**Context**: Fast Cars has committed to net-zero scope 1 and 2 GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions reduction by 2030 (from a 2018 base). Fast Cars has not yet committed to reducing its scope 3 GHG emissions but is considering doing so.  
*scope 1: direct emissions from owned or controlled sources  
scope 2: indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by the reporting company  
scope 3: all other indirect emissions that occur in a company's value chain*

I fetched data from CDP and studied 35 companies in the automotive industry. As is shown in the table, the mode is A-, 71.4% companies score better than the client, 8.6% companies have the same score as the client, 20% companies score worse than the client. In brief, Fast Cars was in a low position in the automotive industry.
## Costs and Benefits
Since the client has a limited budget, we must prioritize initiatives that will have the greatest impact and return on investment. At BCG, we often use abatement cost curve to demonstrate a "step ladder" pathway to net zero.

- **Supply Chain Optimization**: client can reduce emissions by selecting suppliers with sustainable practices, optimizing transportation routes, and minimizing waste, which collectively lowers the carbon footprint of their operations.
- **Renewable Energy Contracts**: Securing renewable energy contracts ensures the client's electricity comes from clean sources, directly reducing emissions associated with purchased power.
-**Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)**: Investing in CCS technologies captures and stores CO2 emissions, contributing to an overall reduction in client's carbon emissions, though not directly targeting onsite gas boilers or purchased electricity.
[BCG, Who Will Drive Electric Cars to the Tipping Point](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/drive-electric-cars-to-the-tipping-point)  
- **Electrification**: The client can reduce emissions by transitioning their vehicle fleet to electric models, which directly cuts reliance on fossil fuels and decreases the carbon footprint associated with electricity and gas boilers.
- **Charging Infrastructure**: Developing a widespread EV charging network encourages consumer adoption of electric cars, reducing the overall demand for gasoline and indirectly lowering emissions from the client's manufacturing processes.
- **Battery Innovation**: Investing in advanced battery technology can make EVs more competitive by increasing range and reducing costs, which accelerates the shift to electric mobility and contributes to a lower-emission automotive industry.

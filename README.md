# Climate & Sustainability Virtual Experience Program
## Setting the Baseline
Client: Fast Cars  
BCG task: help them deliver on their Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) pledge to reduce their carbon emissions 
My task: help to understand the current emissions profile of Fast Cars  
Background: Fast Cars has committed to net-zero scope 1 and 2 GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions reduction by 2030 (from a 2018 base). Fast Cars has not committed yet to reducing its scope 3 GHG emissions but is considering doing so in the future.  
scope 1: direct emissions from owned or controlled sources  
scope 2: indirect emissions from the generation of purchased purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling consumed by the reporting company  
scope 3: all other indirect emissions that occur in a company’s value chain

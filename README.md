# Climate & Sustainability Virtual Experience Program
## Setting the Baseline
Client: Fast Cars  
BCG task: help them deliver on their Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) pledge to reduce their carbon emissions  
My task: help to understand the current emissions profile of Fast Cars  
Background: Fast Cars has committed to net-zero scope 1 and 2 GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions reduction by 2030 (from a 2018 base). Fast Cars has not yet committed to reducing its scope 3 GHG emissions but is considering doing so.  
scope 1: direct emissions from owned or controlled sources  
scope 2: indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by the reporting company  
scope 3: all other indirect emissions that occur in a company’s value chain

I analyzed the companies in the automotive industry that scored better than, the same as, or up to two scores worse than Fast Cars on their Climate Change score. As is shown in the graph below, 44.68% of companies have a higher score than Fast Cars, 36.17% of companies have the same score, and 19.15% have a lower score. Fast Cars needs to reduce emissions to surpass over half of companies with a score over C. Europe has the most companies with a higher score and the most with a lower score. From the view of the country unit, Germany is the leader in climate change score, and the amount difference is slight among countries with a lower score.
